# Set up Samba and UFW for NAS using Salt

This is a small project for Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences Configuration Management Systems course.
This project was made by [Mikko Niskala](https://github.com/Mikko-3) and [Niilo Myllynen](https://github.com/AntoineOkun).
Main idea of the project was to set up a Samba standalone server to share files over the local network and manage it with Salt.
Uncomplicated Firewall was included to make setting up firewall rules easier.
